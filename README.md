# Tools

The following app utilizes React-Native via the [Expo SDK](https://expo.io/tools) with [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/) for its back-end.

IDEs such as Snack are recommended as they include tools such as ESLint.

When using the above, be sure to import the following:

```sh
$ import * as React from 'react';
$ import { /* Any APIs you need here */ }  from 'react-native';
```
